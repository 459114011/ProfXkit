Demo:
Just run fitCuboid.m without any argument.

Function:

This program takes input of the image coordinate of the 7 corners of a
cuboid, and fit a 3D cuboid, and output the new image coordinate of the
corners.

If changeID is 1-7, it will ignore that corner, and use the rest of the
corners to estimate the result.
If changeID is 8, it will use all 7 corners to fit the cuboid.
